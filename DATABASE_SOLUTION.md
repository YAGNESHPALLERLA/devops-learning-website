# üóÑÔ∏è Database Connection Solution

## Current Issue
The Jobcy backend at `https://jobcy-job-portal.vercel.app` is returning 404 errors, indicating:
- Database connection issues
- API routing problems
- Environment variable misconfigurations

## Solutions

### Option 1: Fix Jobcy Backend (Recommended)
1. **Check Jobcy Repository:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Karthik2340/jobcy-job-portal
   - Check if the backend is properly deployed
   - Verify database connection settings

2. **Check Environment Variables:**
   - MongoDB connection string
   - API route configurations
   - CORS settings

3. **Redeploy Jobcy Backend:**
   - Fix any issues found
   - Redeploy to Vercel
   - Test the API endpoints

### Option 2: Use Your Own Database
If the Jobcy backend can't be fixed quickly, we can:

1. **Set up MongoDB Atlas:**
   - Create a free MongoDB Atlas account
   - Create a new cluster
   - Get the connection string

2. **Create Your Own API Routes:**
   - Replace the proxy routes with direct database connections
   - Handle user registration and login directly
   - Use the same database structure as Jobcy

3. **Benefits:**
   - Full control over the database
   - No dependency on external services
   - Better performance and reliability

## Immediate Action Required

**Please check the Jobcy backend repository and fix the database connection issues.**

The current error shows the backend is not properly configured, which is why registration is failing with 500 errors.

## Next Steps

1. Check Jobcy backend repository status
2. Fix database connection issues
3. Redeploy the backend
4. Test the API endpoints
5. If that fails, we can set up your own database
