# Company Portal Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a complete Company Portal system that allows companies to view jobs posted by their HR staff and manage applications received for those jobs.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Company Dashboard (`/company/dashboard`)
- **Overview Tab**: Shows company statistics (HRs, jobs, applications)
- **Jobs Tab**: Lists all jobs posted by company's HR staff
- **Applications Tab**: Shows all applications with management capabilities
- **Status Management**: Update application statuses (Under Review, Interview, Accepted, Rejected)
- **Real-time Statistics**: Dynamic dashboard with live data

### 2. Company Authentication
- **Login Page**: `/company/auth/login`
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Role-based Access**: Companies authenticate with "admin" role

### 3. HR-Company Linking System
- **Company Selection**: Admin can link HR users to companies when creating them
- **Automatic Association**: Jobs posted by HR users automatically associated with their company
- **Data Isolation**: Each company sees only their own data

### 4. Application Management
- **Status Updates**: Companies can change application statuses
- **Candidate Details**: View full candidate profiles, skills, resumes
- **Resume Download**: Direct download links for candidate resumes
- **Notifications**: Automatic notifications sent to candidates on status change

## Files Modified

### Backend

1. **`jobcy-backend-main/models/User.js`**
   - Added `companyId` field (ObjectId reference to Company model)
   - Links HR users to companies

2. **`jobcy-backend-main/controllers/authController.js`**
   - Updated `registerHR()` to accept `companyId` parameter
   - Links HR users to companies during registration

3. **`jobcy-backend-main/middleware/authMiddleware.js`**
   - Updated `protect()` middleware to check both User and Company models
   - Enables company authentication

4. **`jobcy-backend-main/app.js`**
   - Added company dashboard routes
   - `app.use("/api/company", companyDashboardRoutes)`

### Frontend

5. **`jobcy-frontend-main/src/app/admin/hr-management/page.tsx`**
   - Added company dropdown in HR registration form
   - Fetches all registered companies
   - Sends `companyId` when creating HR users
   - Auto-fills company name when selecting from dropdown

6. **`jobcy-frontend-main/src/app/page.tsx`**
   - Added "Access Portals" section in footer
   - Includes link to Company Portal login

## Database Schema Changes

### User Model
```javascript
companyId: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: "Company",
  required: false,
}
```

This field links HR users to companies. When an HR user has a `companyId`:
- All jobs they post are associated with that company
- The company can view and manage those jobs
- The company can see applications for those jobs

## Data Flow

### Job Association
```
Admin creates HR → HR has companyId → HR posts Job → 
Job.postedBy = HR._id → Company queries jobs where postedBy.companyId = Company._id
```

### Application Association
```
User applies → Application.jobId = Job._id →
Company finds: HRs with companyId → Jobs from those HRs → Applications for those jobs
```

## API Endpoints Added

### Company Dashboard
- **GET** `/api/company/dashboard` - Get company statistics
- **GET** `/api/company/jobs` - Get all company jobs
- **GET** `/api/company/applications` - Get all applications
- **PUT** `/api/company/applications/:id/status` - Update application status

### Authentication
- **POST** `/api/auth/login-company` - Company login (already existed)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database
No migration needed. The `companyId` field is optional, so existing HR users continue to work.

### 2. Backend
```bash
cd jobcy-backend-main
npm install
npm start
```

Server runs on http://localhost:5000

### 3. Frontend
```bash
cd jobcy-frontend-main
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000

### 4. Environment Variables

**Backend** (`.env`):
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Frontend** (`.env.local`):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Charts and graphs for hiring metrics
2. **Interview Scheduling**: Built-in calendar for scheduling
3. **Bulk Actions**: Update multiple applications at once

6. **Email Integration**: Send emails directly from platform
7. **Collaboration**: Multiple company admins with different permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Company sees no jobs
**Solution**: Verify HR users have `companyId` field set. Check in MongoDB:
```javascript
db.users.find({ role: "hr" }, { name: 1, email: 1, companyId: 1 })
```

If `companyId` is missing, update manually:
```javascript
db.users.updateOne(
  { _id: ObjectId("hr_user_id") },
  { $set: { companyId: ObjectId("company_id") } }
)
```

### Issue: Applications not showing
**Solution**: Verify jobs have `postedBy` field linking to HR users with `companyId`

### Issue: Can't login as company
**Solution**: 
- Verify company exists in database
- Check email/password
- Verify `loginCompany` endpoint is working
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: HR creation fails when selecting company
**Solution**:
- Restart backend server to load new routes
- Verify `/api/admin/companies` endpoint returns companies
- Check browser network tab for errors

## Support

For issues:
1. Check `COMPANY_PORTAL_GUIDE.md` for detailed documentation
2. Review browser console for frontend errors
3. Check backend console for API errors
4. Verify database connections and data
5. Check JWT token validity

## Conclusion

The Company Portal system is now fully operational. Companies can:
- Login to their dedicated dashboard
- View jobs posted by their HR staff
- Manage applications and candidate profiles
- Update application statuses
- Download resumes

The system is secure, scalable, and ready for production use.
