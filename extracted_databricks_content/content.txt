Azure Databricks
Introduction to Azure Databricks
What is Azure Databricks?
Azure Databricks is a cloud platform that helps people work with data and artificial intelligence in one place. It brings together tools for data engineering, data science, and machine learning, so teams can easily collect, clean, and 
analyze
 data.
It uses a “
lakehouse
” design, a mix of a data lake and a data warehouse, which makes it easier to store large amounts of data and use it quickly for insights or AI projects. Databricks is built on open-source tools like Apache Spark and Delta Lake, and it can run on major cloud platforms such as Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud.
Azure Databricks is a cloud-based platform that helps you work with data, analytics, and AI in one place. It combines tools for storing, processing, and 
analyzing
 data so that teams can easily build and share data projects.
It connects directly with your cloud storage and takes care of setting up and managing the required infrastructure for you.
Using Generative AI, Azure Databricks can understand your data and automatically improve performance to meet your needs. It also uses natural language processing (NLP), which means you can find data or get help just by typing questions in plain English. It can even help you write code, fix issues, and explore documentation easily.

SQL Data Warehouse
A SQL Warehouse (formerly called SQL Endpoint) is the compute resource in Databricks used to run SQL queries, dashboards, and alerts.
It is designed for data analysts, BI developers, and engineers who work with SQL-based data processing — similar to how a cluster runs notebooks, but optimized for SQL workloads.

 timeout to save costs
Max concurrency
 (how many queries run at once)
Permissions
 (who can access or run queries)
Channel
 (stable, preview, etc.)
